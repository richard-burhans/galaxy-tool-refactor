# Decisions and Assumptions

A maintainer-facing record of every non-obvious assumption and design
decision in `galaxy-tool-xml-codemod`. Live document — extend when new
evidence arrives or an assumption changes.

The narrative architecture lives elsewhere: `CLAUDE.md` (current state),
`README.md` (intro), `PLAN.md` (milestone plan and open questions),
`docs/architecture.md` (forked from
`galaxy-tool-xml/docs/codemod-architecture.md`). This file is the
**why** for the choices those docs reflect.

Each entry should answer: *what we assume / chose · what the alternative
was · what evidence or constraint settled it*. Mirror the conventions of
`galaxy-tool-xml/docs/decisions.md`: § numbering, date stamps, and a
reproducible command for any data-driven claim.

---

## 1. `parse_module` signature is narrower than Tier 1's `Source`

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (M1 design).

- **What we chose:** `parse_module(source: Path | bytes | ToolDocument)`.
- **Alternative:** Mirror Tier 1's `Source = str | Path | bytes | BinaryIO`,
  add `ToolDocument`.
- **Why:** dignified-python prefers one clear call site per input form;
  mypy strict catches misuse at the call site. `BinaryIO` is unused —
  codemods don't stream. `str`-as-path is awkward because the LBYL
  `isinstance` ladder would have to disambiguate `str` (a path? raw
  XML?) from `bytes`. Callers with a string path wrap it:
  `parse_module(Path(s))`. Revisit if real callers complain.

## 2. `parse_module` is strict on bytes — matches `load_tool`

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (M1 design).

- **What we chose:** Any well-formedness error on `bytes` input raises
  `ToolXmlSyntaxError`. Implementation funnels both `Path` and `bytes`
  through `galaxy_tool_xml.binding.load_tool`.
- **Alternative:** Route bytes through the lenient `parse_tool` and
  raise only when recovery yields no document at all.
- **Why:** `parse_module`'s contract is "returns a `Module` or raises"
  — symmetric across input forms is simpler to teach. A
  partially-recovered tree with embedded syntax errors is a footgun for
  a refactoring tool, where the user expects the input to round-trip.
  `ToolXmlSyntaxError` is already a public Tier 1 type, so the API
  surface does not grow.

## 3. `parse_module(ToolDocument)` shares the document by reference

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (M1 design).

- **What we chose:** `parse_module(doc)` returns a `Module` whose
  `.document is doc` — no copy.
- **Alternative:** Defensive `copy.deepcopy(doc.tree)` inside
  `parse_module`.
- **Why:** Atomicity by deep-copy snapshot is the **harness's** job per
  `docs/architecture.md` § Atomicity. Splitting it between parser and
  harness creates two truths about who copies; pinning the policy to
  the harness keeps `parse_module` cheap and predictable. The harness
  takes a snapshot on entry, runs the codemod against the copy,
  discards on failure, promotes on success.

## 4. `Module` is a frozen dataclass with a public `document` field

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (M1 design).

- **What we chose:** `@dataclass(frozen=True)` with `document:
  ToolDocument` as a public field (no `_document` + getter property).
- **Alternative:** Plain `@dataclass` with `_document` private and a
  read-only `@property document(self)`.
- **Why:** `Module` has no invariant to defend — the wrapper is just a
  bag of three accessors (document, model, cursor). Frozen signals that
  the wrapper identity is stable for the life of a codemod run (the
  underlying lxml tree mutates in place; the `Module` does not get
  reassigned). Frozen also makes the dataclass hashable, useful for
  caches later.

## 5. `Module.model` is a plain `@property` — not cached

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (post-audit).

- **What we chose:** `@property` that re-binds the typed model against
  the current tree on every access.
- **Alternative:** `@cached_property` for the original M1 design (xsdata
  binding is not free).
- **Why:** The cached property silently returned stale data after any
  codemod mutated the underlying tree. The next codemod author reading
  `module.model` after a sibling codemod's mutation would have seen
  pre-mutation values with no error. xsdata binding is cheap enough for
  tool-sized trees that the no-staleness contract wins over the small
  CPU saving. A caller that needs many model reads can capture the
  result locally.

## 6. Visitor dispatch by tag-PascalCase, not typed-model class

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (M3 design).

- **What we chose:** `_visit_method_name("param") → "visit_Param"` —
  string transformation of the XML tag.
- **Alternative:** Look up the typed-model class for the element's
  position in the tree and dispatch on that class name (so
  `<when>` inside `<conditional>` dispatches as
  `visit_ConditionalWhen`, `<when>` inside `<change_format>` as
  `visit_ChangeFormatWhen`, …).
- **Why:** The architecture targets typed-class dispatch long-term, but
  the two structural codemods we ship operate on tags
  (`<param>`, `<tool>`) where the typed-class name is unambiguous
  anyway. Per-position typed-class resolution is non-trivial work
  (`Cursor` needs to know its parent type), deferred until a codemod
  actually needs to distinguish per-context variants of a tag.
  Tag-PascalCase reads naturally and matches the long-term spelling for
  unambiguous tags.

## 7. `Cursor.reorder_attributes` raises on non-permutation

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (M2 design).

- **What we chose:** `ValueError` when `names` is not a permutation of
  the element's current attribute names.
- **Alternative:** Silent no-op (the behaviour of the deleted
  `galaxy-tool-xml-fmt` `ReorderAttributes` edit case).
- **Why:** A codemod that builds `names` from `canonical_order` cannot
  produce a non-permutation by construction — the only way to hit the
  error is a programmer bug. Raising surfaces the bug at the offending
  line; silent no-op buries it as "this codemod doesn't seem to reorder
  some tools." The cost of the defensive `set(names) != set(current)`
  check is negligible; the loud failure is worth it.

## 8. `MACRO_MODE` removed pending a real consumer

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (post-audit, M3 cleanup).

- **What we chose:** No `MACRO_MODE` ClassVar on `CodemodCommand`.
- **Alternative:** Keep the declared-but-unused ClassVar (the original
  M3 plan) so future codemods have a structured place to declare their
  macro-handling expectation.
- **Why:** YAGNI. The harness never read `MACRO_MODE`, so any codemod
  that set it would silently get the default (un-macro-aware) behaviour
  with no enforcement — a false sense of safety. Re-introduce the
  contract when a codemod that needs macro expansion / stripping is
  actually written, and when the harness has the logic to honour it.

## 9. Three-tier independence: fmt's library does not depend on codemod

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (architecture correction).

- **What we chose:** `galaxy-tool-xml-fmt` declares
  `galaxy-tool-xml-codemod` as an **optional extra** (`[canonical]`),
  not a hard dependency. fmt's library (`format_tool_document`) is
  cosmetic-only. fmt's CLI uses `importlib.util.find_spec` to detect
  the optional package at runtime and orchestrates
  `CANONICAL_CODEMODS` before its cosmetic rules when present.
- **Alternative:** Hard dependency from fmt → codemod; merge
  `MANDATORY_CODEMODS` into `format_tool_document`.
- **Why:** A user who only wants cosmetic formatting (the simplest
  install path: `xml + fmt`) must not be forced to pull in the codemod
  framework. The "default operation" — produce conformant XML — uses
  all three layers, but that's a workflow concern owned by the CLI, not
  a library contract. Keeping the layers independent means the codemod
  package can grow new structural rules without forcing fmt re-releases,
  and the fmt cosmetic pipeline can be consumed standalone (e.g. by
  other tools that already do their own structural canonicalisation).

## 10. `CANONICAL_CODEMODS` (renamed from `MANDATORY_CODEMODS`)

**Date:** 2026-05-28 (architecture correction).

- **What we chose:** The public tuple is named `CANONICAL_CODEMODS` and
  lives in `canonical.py`.
- **Alternative:** Keep the original `MANDATORY_CODEMODS` /
  `mandatory.py` naming from the initial design.
- **Why:** "Mandatory" made sense when fmt's library hard-ran the set.
  After decision 9 (fmt no longer hard-depends), nothing forces these
  codemods to run — fmt's CLI runs them by default but a caller using
  fmt's library directly may not. "Canonical" reads correctly in the
  current shape: "these are the codemods that produce the canonical
  output you'll get when you run `galaxy-tool-xml-fmt` with the
  `[canonical]` extra installed."
